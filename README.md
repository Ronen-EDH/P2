# Holiday Planning Tool

This is an OpenClassrooms student repo for project 2 by EDH.

## Project Description

My task was for this project is to turn a design mock-up into a web page with HTML & CSS.

Requirements:
- It is important to use semantic tags
- The code should be valid according to the W3C HTML and CSS validators
- The mockup should be compatible with the latest versions of Google Chrome  
and Mozilla Firefox. You should test the prototype on these two browsers
- You should not use any CSS frameworks (such as BootStrap or TailwindCSS) or pre-processors (such as Sass or Less)

## Technologies Used 

HTML to create the structure for the website, CSS for design elements, CSS flexbox for layout.
Also used global CSS variables and semantic tags.
