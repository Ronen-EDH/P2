# Holiday Planning Tool for Booki

This is an OpenClassrooms student repo for project 2 by EDH.

## Project Description

### Scenario 

Booki's website helps its users to find accommodation and activities in a town of their choosing.
My task was for this project is to turn a design mock-up into a web page with HTML & CSS.

### Main functional requirements
- Accommodation and Activities in the header should be entirely
clickable (and not just the title). For the time being the links are
empty. You can use a “href=”#” attribute to simulate the presence of
a link
- Users will be able to search for accommodation in the town of their
choosing. The search field is an input field, so users will need to be
able to edit this
- The filter buttons should change appearance during mouseover

### Main technical requirements
- The site will have to be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
Regarding breakpoints: 992px for computer screens, 768px for tablets
and below 768 for mobile phones
- It is important to use semantic tags
- The code should be valid according to the W3C HTML and CSS validators
- The mockup should be compatible with the latest versions of Google Chrome  
and Mozilla Firefox. You should test the prototype on these two browsers
- You should not use any CSS frameworks (such as BootStrap or TailwindCSS) or pre-processors (such as Sass or Less)

## Technologies Used 

HTML to create the structure for the website, CSS for design elements, and CSS flexbox for layout.
Also used global CSS variables and semantic tags.
